# BSReplayTweaker
Used for content creators to get a clean environment, when recording replays in Beat Saber.

## Disables the following UI elements, only when watching replays:
- "REPLAY"-watermark added by BeatLeader
- "REPLAY"-watermark added by ScoreSaber.
- "CUSTOM NOTES ENABLED"-watermark added by CustomNotes.

No menus, no hidden settings, no bullshit. Install and forget.

If you for some reason, idk why you'd want it, want the watermarks back, close your game, delete the plugin, and they're back.
